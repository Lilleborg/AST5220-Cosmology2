See Examples.cpp (make examples; ./examples to compile it and run) for examples on how to make splines, solve ODEs, etc.
and the functionality of the stuff supplied with this template

The code runs from Main.cpp. See this file for the order of things to implement.

Compile the code running ( make )

If you want to compile this on your computer you need to install the GSL library first
You can find it here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/gsl-2.6.tar.gz
After installing it you need to add the include and library dir to the Makefile

In the last module you will also need a library for Bessel functions (the GSL one often fails for very large inputs), if 
COMPLEX_BESSEL is defined in the makefile then you will have to have this library installed:
https://github.com/joeydumont/complex_bessel
If you don't have this then just comment out the two lines below ( "Add bessel function library" ) in the Makefile
